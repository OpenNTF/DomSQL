Description
=======
The JDBC Access for IBM Lotus Domino (a.k.a. DomSQL) Project exposes Domino data as relational tables and provides easy access to the tables using a JDBC driver.

Important Note 1 : From release 20140829 onwards, the DomSQL project requires a v9.0.1 Domino server (and Domino Designer) that has ExtLib_v901_release7 or later installed. If you are using an earlier server and/or ExtLib configuration, then download an earlier version of the DomSQL project.

Important Note 2 : The provided XPagesDomSQL.nsf demo application requires the XPages RDBMS Enablement project to be installed to the server, more specifically the Apache Derby JDBC driver plugin provided in that project. This can be downloaded from its OpenNTF project page
